Network Anomaly Detection Based on Multiclass Classification in UNSW_NB15 Dataset

This study is conducted to explore effectiveness of  previous approaches to detect network intrusion type based on network anomaly detection 
and devise new approach for selected dataset. 

To drive the study, one of the well known dataset UNSW-NB15 has been selected to use.
